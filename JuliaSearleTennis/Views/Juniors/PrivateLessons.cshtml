                                Private groups can be booked as an alternative to the group coaching programme. A term must be booked up front in line with the same dates as our terms programme.

                                However, if you provide 48hours notice of cancellation for a session, you will not miss out and your coach will credit  you for the following term. Private Groups cannot be arranged for more than four players. If you would like a larger group, we can add one to our regular term time coaching programme.
